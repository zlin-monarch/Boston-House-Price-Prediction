# Version 2

## Updates 
1. Configured `project.toml` to specify Python 3.7 and package dependencies, simplifying installation and avoiding version-related issues.
2. Transitioned from a Flask application to a Streamlit app, streamlining frontend development.
3. Created `docker-compose.yaml` for easy Docker container management with the command `docker-compose up --build`.
4. Utilized `minikube` for service deployment and `kubectl scale` for pod scaling.
